%h1 Permissions Policy
%p With the exception of “guest posts” written by others (see the bottom of this page), I own the content on this Web site. It is copyrighted in my name. I want to strike the appropriate balance between getting my content widely distributed while at the same time protecting my intellectual property rights. Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

%h2#without-my-permission Without My Permission

%p You are free to do the following without my permission:
%ul
  %li Link to my site or any specific post on my site.
  %li Extract and re-post less than 200 words on any other site, provided you link back to my original post.
  %li Print off my posts and photocopy up to 50 copies for internal distribution within your own company or organization.
  %li
    Print my posts in any non-commercial publication (e.g., company newsletter, church newsletter, class syllabus, etc.), provided you include this copyright notice: “© , Benjamin C. Wilson. All rights reserved. Originally published at

%h2#not-without-my-permission Not Without My Permission

%p You must have my express written consent to do any of the following:
%ul
  %li Use this content in for commercial purposes, including selling or licensing printed or digital versions of my content.
  %li Alter, transform, or build upon this work.

%h2#re-posting-and-translation-rights Re-Posting and Translation Rights

%p I do not permit the re-posting of my posts in their entirety. This is because Google penalizes websites for publishing duplicate content. It often can’t tell which site hosts the original, so I risk getting penalized myself for granting permission.
%p In addition, I don’t allow the translation and publication of my work in other languages. I simply don’t have the resources to validate the quality of the work.

%h2#guest-posts Guest Posts

%p Guest bloggers retain the copyright to the posts they write. The above permission guidelines do not apply to their work. If you are interested in re-posting or publishing their content, you must contact them directly. I cannot serve as a broker, agent, or contact point.
